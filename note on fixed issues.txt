Click track not being sent through the interface:
- fixed, A/B button was not depressed

Super fast heart beat on movements 1 and 2:
- fixed, The heatbeat encapsulation was using had been reworked to
   use the tempo object - which takes bpm's - but it was still receiving the
   ms output from hrmi_reader, causing it to set tempos in the 600s-700s (though 
   tempo caps out at around 250-300)

Heart beat cutting out during performance,
- can't reproduce, I think it was an issue of the heart beat getting too high 
   combined with the the ms/bpm switch that was going on.

Proper measure switching support for movement 2:
-

Turn of torch when switching movements
- Even if it's going back to 1 again, reset it.
- Fixed, when reset was sent to p measureSwitcher, it was not hitting uzistart to 
   actually starting the process of iterating through all of the lines of the
   counterTorch file up until the desired measure (aka 0 time)

Add click track with downbeat
