------- Introduction -------

As you are probably able to figure out, this is the help file for the
piece Pulse for solo Flute, Computer, and Heart Rate Monitor.  This
file describes how to set up and operate the hardware and software of
the piece.

------- Getting Started -------

The patch is divided into two sections: the measure/movement display
section on the left, and the commands/information section on the right.

The measure/movement displays the current measure and movement (including interludes)
so that they can be read for a distance - in case the performer isn't
able to have the laptop close to them.

The commands/information section is where all the settings, levels,
and control interfaces are.  They are described in detail below.

------- Quick Setup -------

When using the Polar Heart Rate Monitor:

1. Set up PA system/audio interface/etc.
2. Put on heart rate monitor/plug in heart rate monitor interface (see
       Connecting/Wearing Heart Rate Monitor and Interface). 
3. Open Max patch (pulse.maxpat)
4. Click "Select Port"
5. Select the proper port from menu (see Select Port)
6. Hit Start!
7. To stop, hit Stop!

When using practice mode:

1. Set up PA system/audio interface/etc.
2. Open max patch (pulse.maxpat)
3. Click the "Start Practice Mode" button
4. Adjust tempo using Set Practice Mode Tempo
5. To stop, hit Stop!

------- Recommendations -------

It is recommended that a second performer control the levels of the
electronics via a mixer. This will allow for more fine grained control
of the dynamics in the electronics.

A click track is provided for the performer (and because of the constantly
changing tempo, it is highly recommended that it be used). The click
track outputs to channels 3 and 4, which the headphones should be plugged into.

When using the heart rate monitor, it is recommended that a heart rate
monitor electrode cream be used to ensure a more consistent connection
between the skin and the sensor (Buh-Bump is one brand of cream).

======= MEASURE/MOVEMENT SECTION =======

------- Measure Display -------

Displays the current measure.

------- Movement Display -------

Displays the current movement (including interludes).


======= COMMANDS/INFORMATION SECTION  ======= 

------- Select Movement -------

Use the 1, 2 & 3 buttons below "Select Movement" to automatically
switch to the desired movement.

------- Start! -------

Hit this button to start the piece.
It will automatically turn on the audio, and begin the piece in
measure 1 of movement 1.

------- Stop! -------

Stops the audio, unfortunately, in the current state of the patch, pushing
Stop! will stop the audio, but the measure count will continue to increase.
Therefore, Stop! should be thought of as a hard stop, and not a pause
button.

------- Select Measure -------

To move to a specific measure in the current movement, use the number box to the right
to select a measure to move to, and then hit the button to the right of Set.
This will move the electronics to that measure in the current movement.

------- Automatically Switch Movements -------

Select this option if you wish to have the piece automatically move to
the next movement at the end of the current one movement to movement
(including the interludes).  If it is not selected, then you will have to
manually switch between movements using the Select Movements buttons.

------- Heart Rate Display -------

Displays the current heart beat (in BPM).

------- Click Track Volume -------

Use this slider to adjust the volume of the click track (which outputs to
tracks 3 & 4).

------- Select Port -------

Click "Select Port" to open the port selection interface.  The port selection
interface is how you select the port that the Polar Heart Rate Monitor Interface
is plugged into.

To figure out which port this is, unplug all USB devices, except for the
Interface, restart the patch, and open the port selection interface.  Only
the Heart Rate Monitor Interface port should appear. This port name will likely
be something non-descriptive, like COM3.

------- Calibrate Max/Min Heart Rate -------

Click "Calibrate Max/Min Heart Rate" to open the heart rate calibration interface.
This interface is slightly more complicated. Specific instruction is available
on the patch itself.  It does two things: give you a tool to figure out your
maximum and minimum heart rate, and let you manually set the max/min heart rate
(aka the max/min tempo) of the whole piece, or the individual movements.

------- Open Audio Settings -------

Click "Open Audio Settings" to open the audio settings menu.  This menu lets you
map input/output, select drivers, etc.

For more information see: https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/vignettes/audio_status

------- Start Practice Mode -------

A practice mode is also available for playing the piece without the heart
rate monitor.  Simply hit the button to the right of "Start Practice Mode"
and a fake heartbeat will begin driving the electronics.

You can also set the practice mode tempo with the number box below.

If you want to switch back to reading the actual heart beat, hit Start!.

------- Set Practice Mode Tempo -------

To set the tempo in practice mode, simply click on the number box to the
right of "Set Practice Mode Tempo," type your desired tempo, and hit enter.

------- Needed Hardware and Software -------

Here is a list of the required hardware, software, and the optional hardware needed
to perform this piece:

Required Hardware:
 - Stereo PA system
 - A computer
	- That can run Max/MSP 7
	- That has at least 1 USB port
 - Polar T31 Heart Rate Monitor (contact composer to get)
 - Polar Heart Rate Monitor Interface (contact composer)
 - An audio interface with...
	- 2 outputs (required)
	- Or one with 4 outputs (recommended)

Recommended Hardware:
 - Headphones (for listening to the click track in channels 3 & 4,
   	      see Recommendations)
 - A mixer (recommended if performing with two people, see Recommendations)

Software:
 - Max 7
   - A free version that runs the software, but does not allow editing
        can be found here: https://cycling74.com/downloads/runtime/
 - Appropriate audio drivers for your system.

------- Wearing/Connecting Heart Rate Monitor and Interface -------

Note: The Polar T31 Heart Rate Monitor is the belt that you strap to you chest,
the Polar Heart Rate Monitor Interface is the square board that you plug into
the computer via USB.

The heart rate monitor is the sensor that reads your heart rate and wirelessly
transmits that data to the heart rate monitor interface.  The interface then
sends this data to the computer where the Max patch reads the data.

To attach the Polar T31 Heart Rate Monitor to your person:
   1. Fasten one end of the heart rate sensor to the elastic strap.
   2. Moisten the two grooved areas on the back.
   3. Clip the heart rate sensor around your chest and adjust the strap to fit snugly.
   4. Check that the wet grooved areas are firmly against your skin, and
      	    that the text on the heart rate sensor is in an upright position
	    and at the center of your chest.

   Taken from www.polar.com, see site for additional illustrations.

For optimal data transmission between the monitor and the interface, the two
objects should not be further than 80cm (2' 6.5") apart.

------- Setting Up Audio -------

To adjust audio settings, click "Open Audio Settings."

Select the desired audio drivers from the Driver drop down menu.
Select the desired output device from the Output Device drop down menu.
Click on Open I/O Mappings to set what devices channels 1 - 4 output to.
